# Mode System Summary

## Overview

The Mode System is a comprehensive architecture that enables automatic transitions and clear handoffs between different specialized roles in the development process. This document provides a high-level summary of the system and outlines the implementation roadmap.

## Key Components

1. **Mode Controller**
   - Central orchestrator of the mode system
   - Handles task analysis and mode selection
   - Manages state and transitions
   - Coordinates with other components

2. **Mode Registry**
   - Stores mode definitions and configurations
   - Manages capabilities and file patterns
   - Handles mode relationships and dependencies
   - Provides mode validation

3. **Transition Engine**
   - Processes transition rules
   - Manages context during transitions
   - Handles handoff logic
   - Ensures state consistency

## Documentation Structure

1. `mode-system.md`
   - Core architecture documentation
   - Component diagrams
   - System interactions
   - High-level design decisions

2. `mode-configuration.md`
   - Mode definitions
   - Configuration structure
   - File patterns and triggers
   - Handoff specifications

3. `mode-implementation.md`
