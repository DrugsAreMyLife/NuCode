# Original Enhancement Goals for Roo-Code

## Mode System Enhancements

### Core Concept
The goal was to create a more sophisticated mode system that would intelligently adapt to different development contexts and tasks.

### Planned Features

#### 1. Enhanced Mode Definitions
- **Code Mode**: General software development with broad language support
- **Architect Mode**: Focus on system design, patterns, and high-level decisions
- **Frontend Dev Mode**: Specialized for web UI/UX development
- **Backend Dev Mode**: Optimized for server-side and API development
- **UI Designer Mode**: Focused on visual design and CSS
- **Security Mode**: Specialized for security audits and fixes
- **DevOps Mode**: Infrastructure and deployment focused
- **Ask Mode**: General technical Q&A

#### 2. Intelligent Mode Switching
- Automatic detection of context based on:
  - File types being edited
  - Commands being executed
  - Content of user prompts
  - Project structure
- Seamless transition between modes without user intervention
- Ability to suggest mode switches based on task context

#### 3. Mode-Specific Features

##### Per-Mode Configurations
- Custom prompt templates for each mode
- Mode-specific tool access controls
- Specialized model selection per mode
- Context-aware documentation preferences

##### Auto-Switching Rules
- Frontend Mode triggers:
  - Editing CSS/HTML/JS files
  - Working with UI frameworks
  - Discussing layout/styling
- Backend Mode triggers:
  - Database operations
  - API endpoint work
  - Server configuration
- Architect Mode triggers:
  - System design discussions
  - Pattern implementation
  - Architecture documentation
- Security Mode triggers:
  - Security-related keywords
  - Authentication code
  - Dependency audits

#### 4. Model Selection System

##### Automatic Model Selection
- Each mode could have:
  - Primary model selection
  - Fallback model options
  - Cost-performance balancing
  - Capability requirements

##### Model Switching Logic
- Switch based on:
  - Task complexity
  - Required capabilities
  - Performance metrics
  - Cost considerations

### Integration Features

#### 1. Context Awareness
- Project structure understanding
- Technology stack detection
- Framework recognition
- Development patterns identification

#### 2. Performance Optimization
- Mode-specific caching
- Preemptive model loading
- Context retention between switches
- Resource usage optimization

#### 3. User Experience
- Transparent mode transitions
- Clear mode indicators
- Override capabilities
- Mode customization options

### Settings and Configuration

#### 1. Mode Settings
- Custom prompt templates
- Preferred models per mode
- Auto-switch preferences
- Tool access controls

#### 2. Model Configuration
- API keys and endpoints
- Performance thresholds
- Cost limits
- Capability requirements

#### 3. Auto-Switch Settings
- Sensitivity controls
- Trigger customization
- Override conditions
- Transition delays

## Implementation Notes

### Key Components
1. Mode Manager
   - Handles mode state
   - Manages transitions
   - Processes triggers
   - Maintains context

2. Model Selector
   - Evaluates requirements
   - Manages fallbacks
   - Optimizes selection
   - Tracks performance

3. Context Analyzer
   - Monitors workspace
   - Analyzes content
   - Detects patterns
   - Suggests transitions

### Integration Points
1. VSCode Extension
   - File system events
   - Editor interactions
   - Command execution
   - Settings management

2. AI Provider Integration
   - Model capabilities
   - Performance metrics
   - Cost tracking
   - Error handling

### Future Considerations
1. Extensibility
   - Custom mode definitions
   - Plugin system
   - API for third-party integration
   - Community contributions

2. Performance
   - Caching strategies
   - Resource management
   - Optimization techniques
   - Scalability considerations

3. User Experience
   - Feedback mechanisms
   - Configuration UI
   - Documentation
   - Tutorial system

## Implementation Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. Interface Disruption
   - Accidentally removed core functionality while trying to add new features
   - Broke existing UI patterns that users were familiar with
   - Lost important settings and configuration options

2. Integration Approach
   - Tried to modify too many components simultaneously
   - Failed to preserve existing functionality while adding new features
   - Lost sight of the original codebase's design patterns

3. Development Strategy Issues
   - Should have:
     * Started with the original Roo-Code as base
     * Added new features incrementally
     * Preserved all existing functionality
     * Maintained UI/UX consistency
     * Tested each change thoroughly

### Recommended Approach for Next Attempt
1. Start Fresh
   - Begin with original Roo-Code repository
   - Create clear enhancement plan
   - Document existing functionality thoroughly
   - Identify integration points carefully

2. Incremental Implementation
   - Add mode system without disrupting existing UI
   - Implement auto-switching as separate feature
   - Enhance model selection system gradually
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. Testing Strategy
   - Verify existing features after each change
   - Test new functionality in isolation
   - Ensure UI remains consistent
   - Validate all settings and configurations

## Architectural Principles for Implementation

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Mode system should be independent of UI
- Model selection logic separate from mode management
- Context analysis isolated from mode switching
- Settings management decoupled from feature implementation

### 2. Extension Points
- Design for extensibility from the start
- Clear interfaces for adding new modes
- Plugin system for custom triggers
- Flexible model integration points

### 3. State Management
- Centralized state for mode system
- Clear state transitions
- Predictable behavior
- Observable state changes

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for mode switching
- Clear error messages
- Recovery mechanisms
- State consistency maintenance

### 5. Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of mode-specific features
- Efficient context analysis
- Optimized model switching
- Minimal UI updates

### 6. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for mode switching
- UI tests for settings and configuration
- Performance benchmarks
