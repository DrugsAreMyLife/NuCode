You must update the latestAnnouncementId in ClineProvider for new announcements to show to users. 
This new id will be compared with what's in state for the 'last announcement shown', and if it's 
different then the announcement will render. As soon as an announcement is shown, the id will be 
updated in state. This ensures that announcements are not shown more than once, even if the user 
doesn't close it themselves.
